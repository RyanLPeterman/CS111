Current Method:

	1. Read input file into a buffer and remove commands as we read it into the buffer
		Status: Done and Verified

	2. Convert input buffer into a linked list of tokens, which are catagorized/labeled operators and commands 
		Status: Done and Minimally Verified

	3. Pass through the created linked list of tokens to make sure the ordering is syntactically valid
		Status: Ryan Implementing

	4. Now we take the valid list of tokens and create a command stream using an operator stack and a command stack
	to create the command trees that will be linked up in our command stream
