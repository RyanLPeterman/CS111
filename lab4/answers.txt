# NOTES FROM DISCUSSION
- errors in code:
    - start_download() has buffer overflow
    - task_upload() has buffer overflow
    - task_upload() should only upload files in current directory
- other problems:
    - limit max download size
    - limit max peers
    - fix "tracker closed prematurely"
- own finds:
    - task_download() has buffer overflow

# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)

	General Method for Parallel Requests:
		1. Fork all the downloads
		2. Wait for all downloads to finish
			- This protects agains an upload requesting a file that is not 
			finished downloading yet
		3. Fork all uploads
		4. Wait for all uploads to finish so we can terminate parent process

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

1. In start_download() and task_download(), a filename with a length greater 
than FILENAMESIZ-1 would have caused a buffer overflow. This was fixed by 
using strncpy() in place of strcpy(), to ensure that the filename had only
FILENAMESIZ-1 characters (with a '\0' appended to the end).

2. There was another buffer overflow bug in task_download() due to the use 
of sprintf(). This bug occurs when there is a duplicate filename and the 
filename must be extended to "[filename]~[number]~", which can exceed 
FILENAMESIZ characters. We replaced sprintf() with snprintf() and specified 
a buffer size of FILENAMESIZ to fix the issue.

3. In task_upload(), osp2p_snscanf() is used to parse for a filename with 
t->tail as the length. This can lead to a buffer overflow because t->tail 
is normally used with t->buf, which has a size (TASKBUFSIZ=4096) much 
greater than t->filename's size (FILENAMESIZ=256). We set t->tail to the 
minimum of t->tail and FILENAMESIZ-1, so that a maximum of FILENAMESIZ-1 
characters will be read into t->filename.

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

1. Upload request might ask for a file outside the current working directory
	
	fix (task_upload): compare current working directory with the real path in
	task_upload and if they're not the same, exit

2. Downloading file could potentially be an exceedingly large file that would 
consume all disk space.

	fix (task_download): define a max file size macro such that we check it 
	the number of downloaded bytes with that max file size. If the number of 
	bytes written is larger than the max file size we specified, then we 
	clean up the partially written files and return such that we do not complete 
	the request.

3. Problem when there are too many trackers for the peer to handle which 
causes "tracker closed prematurely error".

	fix (at top of osppeer.c): increase the size of TASKBUFSIZ fixes the 
	problem since now we can handle more peers, but there may be a better 
	solution

	// TODO Think about a better solution to this problem
